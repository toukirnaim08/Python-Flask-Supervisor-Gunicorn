# Python-Flask-Supervisor-Gunicorn

Supervisor is a monitoring tool which controls various child processes and handles starting/restarting of these child processes when they exit abruptly or exit due to some reasons.

In this project, I will demonstrate how to set up Supervisor to work with our application. For this, I will create a simple application in Flask along with Gunicorn to act as our WSGI HTTP server. 

I assume that you have a basic understanding of Flask, Gunicorn and environment setup using virtualenv while developing a Python application.
